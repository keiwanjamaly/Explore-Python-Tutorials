    "In **Lecture 2** we learned how to use **lists** and **arrays** as data structures. In this lecture we introduce **dictionaries**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are Dictionaries?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary consists of keys and values assigned to those keys. Since **dictionaries** have similar characteristics to **lists**, it is helpful to compare these two\n",

    "\n",
    "Instead of the numerical indexes, dictionaries have keys, which are non-mutable objects like **strings** or **tuples**. These keys are the \"indexes\" that are used to access values within a dictionary. \n",
    "Likewise **lists**, **dictionaries** are mutable objects, which means  we can modify them, change values for a given key, add new keys with their corresponding values, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The python syntax to create a dictionary is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "my_dictionary = {'key':value}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `type` of a dictionary (`type(my_dictionary)`) is `dict`. \n",

    "### **Accessing the keys of a dictionary**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In case we do not know the keys of a given dictionary, the function `keys()` can be use to obtain a list of the keys of the dictionary.\n",

    "```\n",
    "### **Accessing  the value by the key:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the elements of a given key, we have two options: the first one by using  an  \"indexing\"-like approach. That is\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "my_dictionary['key1']\n",
    "```\n",
    "this will return the output `1`. The second option is by using the  `get()` method. It is used as\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "my_dictionary.get((0, 1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "this will produce the output `6`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is get useful?** If we ask for the value of the dictionary for a given key and the key does not exist in the dictionary, then the `get` method avoids error messages, and simply returns `None`. For instance if we did\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_dictionary.get('key7')\n",
    "```\n",
    "the output will be `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Adding a new element to the dictionary**\n",
    "\n",
    "For **lists** and **arrays** we would had use the `list.append(value)` and `np.append(array,value)` methods respectively. For **dictionaries** instead, we will use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "my_dictionary['key7'] = 'new_value'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Remove a key from a dictionary**\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove an key with its respective values we use the `pop()` method. For instance, if we want to delete the newly assigned `key7` from our dictionary we use:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "my_dictionary.pop('key7')\n",
    "```\n",
    "then, if we ask for the keys of our dictionary \n",
    "```\n",
    "my_dictionary.keys()\n",

    "### Galaxy rotation curve\n",
    "\n",
    "The Directory `Rotation curves`, contains  data sets for the rotation curve for several Dwarf galaxies. See [rotation curves](https://github.com/keiwanjamaly/Python-Tutorials/blob/main/Rotation%20curves/readme.pdf) for a detail description of the data files. In this exercise we will  practice our **pandas** skills on those files (They will also be used in Tutorial 6 using **clases**, and in Tutorial 8, when we covering **function fitting**).\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this exercise we will obtain our Dark Matter rotation curve $$v_{DM}(r) = \\sqrt{v_c^2(r)-v_{star}^2(r)-v_{gas}^2(r)},$$ as well as our DM mass distribution $$M_{DM}(r) = r v^2_{DM}(r)/G . $$ We will plot them  having into account errors in the measurements as well as systematic errors. Let us divide the exercise in several steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose your favorite galaxy, i.e. identify the two files `RotationCurve galaxy.csv` and `RotationCurve baryons galaxy.csv`.\n",
    "2. Create the **DataFrames** `df_circular` and `df_baryon` for each of the two data files. They should look similar to the following example for Galaxy `'IC2574'`:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Figures/cir_vel_baryon.png \"Baryonic circular velocity\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The radial data points used in the two `DataFrames` are different and therefore we want to have the values of `gas circ velocity` and `star circ velocity` evaluated at the same radial positions as `circ velocity`. For that we need to create  **interpolating** functions for the `gas circ velocity` and `star circ velocity` data (We will cover more on interpolating functions in Tutorial 7).  Use \n",
    "```py\n",
    "from scipy.interpolate import interp1d \n",
    "```\n",
    "and then create the interpolating functions with\n",
    "```py\n",
    "stars_circ_velocity = interp1d(r_baryon,v_star,kind = 'quadratic')\n",
    "gas_circ_velocity = interp1d(r_baryon,v_gas,kind = 'quadratic')\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `r_baryon` is the list containing the radial points in `df_baryon` created in step 1. \n",
    "4. Now that we have our two interpolating functions, we can evaluate them at `r_circular`, the radial points given in `df_circular`. Add two new columns to `df_circular` containing the stars and gas circular velocities evaluated at  `r_circular`. At this stage our `df_circular` should look like\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Figures/step_4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. As explained in [rotation curves](https://github.com/keiwanjamaly/Python-Tutorials/blob/main/Rotation%20curves/readme.pdf), some of the measured errors (i.e. some values in `circ velocity error`) have been underestimated. In this step we will  include a systematic error at the level of 5% of the last measured velocity point (i.e. the last data point of column `cir velocity` in our `df_circular`). Add a new column in `df_circular` called `syst error` whose values contain the systematic error. Then, add a new column  `total error`, containing the total error computed as the sum in quadratures of `sys error` and   `circ velocity error`. After this step, our `df_circular` should look like\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Figures/step_5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Let us now add a column with the DM velocity, which is computed from $$v_{DM}(r) = \\sqrt{v_c^2(r)-v_{star}^2(r)-v_{gas}^2(r)},$$ We have to be careful however, since $v_{DM}^2(r)$ could be negative, if that is the case,  we choose to change sign of $v_{gas}^2(r)$.  Similarly, compute $M_{DM}(r)$ and add it as new column (hint: Newton's constant GN = 4.302e-6  km^2/s^2*kpc/Msol ). After this steps,  our `df_circular` should look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Figures/step_6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Plot $v_{DM}(r)$ including error bar given by the `total error` column.  (hint: use the `errorbar` plotting function in `matplotlib`)\n",
    "8. Plot $M_{DM}(r)$. "
