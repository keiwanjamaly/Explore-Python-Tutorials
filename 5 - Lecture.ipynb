    "\n",
    "Instead of the numerical indexes, dictionaries have keys, which are non-mutable objects like **strings** or **tuples**. These keys are the \"indexes\" that are used to access values within a dictionary. \n",
    "Likewise **lists**, **dictionaries** are mutable objects, which means  we can modify them, change values for a given key, add new keys with their corresponding values, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The python syntax to create dictionaries is the following:\n",

    "```py\n",
    "my_dictionary = {'key':value}\n",
    "```\n",
