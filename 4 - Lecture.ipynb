    "Imagine we want to calculate the shape of an unknown curve which starts at a given point $A_0$ at $t_0$ and satisfies a given differential equation. Euler method can be use for such a problem. It approximates the unknown curve as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting at the initial value $A_0$ at $t_0$, from the differential equation we can compute the slope of a tangent line to the curve at $t_0$, and so, the tangent line itself. \n",
    "We then take a small step along our  tangent line until we reach the point $A_1$ at $t_1$. For a t-step small enough, the slope of the curve does not change too much in  this t-displacement and therefore $A_1$ is still close to the curve. We can then repeat the reasoning as for $A_0$, that is,  taking $A_1$ as our initial value, and from the differential equation compute the slope of a tangent line to the curve at $t_1$, then move along the new tangent line until reaching $A_2$ at $t_2$. The process is then repeated until we reach the final time $t_n$, at which we would like to know the value of the unknown value of the  curve $A_n$. \n",
