There is also a **namespace** for included libraries, and one for each function invocation.\n",

(You will probably have troubles loading the data for galaxy `'F563-1'`). We will now proceed to do define a function outside of our class, that plots two columns of  the **DataFrame** `df_circular`, for all of the Galaxy_IDs in the  `Rotation curves` directory. First we need to have a list with the `Galaxy_IDs`. Use the **os** library, and the `os.listdir()` function, to create such a list. Then, define the function `plot` that takes as entries two keywords `x` and `y`. It will loop over all of the elements of `Galaxy_IDs`, creating an instance of the class `rotation_curve` for every iteration,  and plot the columns `x` vs `y` in  the **DataFrame** `df_circular`.  For instance, if you use that function to plot `'radius (kpc)'` vs `'DM circ velocity (km/s)'`, one should get a plot similar to:\n",
