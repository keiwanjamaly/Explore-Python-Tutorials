    "Formally, a **namespace** is a mapping from names to objects. When you type the name of a function or variable, the python interpreter has to map that string to the corresponding object. Depending on the **namespace**, the same name can lead to different objects. For example, there is the **namespace** of built-in functions, such as `abs()` and `max()`. There is also a **namespace** for included libraries, and one for each function invocation.\n",
    "Some examples of the same name being resolved differently depending on the **namespace**:\n",
    "For instance,  although the `abs()` and `np.abs()` functions have the same effect on numbers, they belong to two different **namespaces**.  If we run the lines\n",
