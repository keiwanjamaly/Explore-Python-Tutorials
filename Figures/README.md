# Explore-Python-Tutorials

Welcome to  python programing.  
This repository contains a set of 8 tutorials that cover the basics of  programing using pyhton as  main languange. During this course we will cover the following topics:

Tutorial 1. The basics of pyhton: Lists and numpy arrays, defining basic functions and plotting with matplotlib 

Tutorial 2. Higher dimensional arrays, conditional statements, loops, and generator expressions

Tutorial 3. Numeric Integration (scipy.integrate.quad, dblquad)

Tutorial 4. ODEs (scipy.integrate.solve_ivp): Single ODEs and coupled ODEs (i.e., promote ODE vector equations using numpy arrays)

Tutorial 5. Pandas dataframes: creating, modifying, loading, and saving information

Tutorial 6. Classes: Illustrate as a way of organizing your code effectively.

Tutorial 7. Interpolating functions (scipy.interpolate.InterpolatedUnivariateSpline): this is my preference over interp1d since it has built-in methods for calculating integrals and derivatives of your interpolating function.

Tutorial 8. To-be-determined: Some specific packages (depending on research projects, e.g. HDF5 or astropy)
