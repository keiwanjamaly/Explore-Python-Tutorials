    "Let's assume, you want to integrate the following integral:\n",

    "$\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = \\sum_{i=0}^{N} \\int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} f(x) dx$\n",

It's important to keep in mind, that different methods also require different numbers of function calls. So if f(x) is a very expensive function without a lot of fluctuations, it's better to use the rectangle rule, than the trapezoid rule.\n",

For that reason, clever people have already done this for us and bundled them in a library.

We will now take a look at some of there methods, but a full overview can be seen [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/integrate.html)."
